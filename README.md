# Front End Mentor Single Price Grid Component Challenge Solution

This is a solution to the [Huddle Landing Page with a Single Introductory Section Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

I'm transitioning back into Full-Time Web Development after a long hiatus away from the tech industry. From experience I know the fastest way to learn/relearn any skill is through consistent building and that is why I've found Front End Mentor Challenges to be the perfect fit for me at this stage in my career journey.

This is the eighth challenge I'm attempting. My completion time is getting shorter so I'm definitely excited about that.

## The Challenge

- Build out the Huddle Landing Page with a Single Introductory Section Challenge at [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0] as close to the original design as possible.

## My Process

- I started out with the HTML structuring of the landing page. Positioning the texts, images and button.
- Followed it up with styling each element to mimic what was presented in the challenge design files with CSS.

## Built with

- HTML5 markup.
- CSS3 custom properties.
- Flexbox.

## What I learned

- Improved ability working with CSS Flexbox.
- Manipulating CSS Flexbox rows and column and centering with [margin: auto;]

## Continued Development

- Feel like I'm ready to dive into JS and in the near future go fully into ReactJS. But in the mean time, I'll continue pacing myself and making sure I truely understand the basics of HTML and CSS before moving on.
